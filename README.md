# elementerial-es-de
A port of the [Elementerial](https://github.com/mluizvitor/es-theme-elementerial) theme by [mluizvitor](https://github.com/mluizvitor/es-theme-elementerial/commits?author=mluizvitor) for ES-DE. It's based on Android TV's interface using some principles from Material Design with the addition of ElementaryOS color palette.

## **Preview**

## **Changes made**
- Any changes from the original theme were largely unintentional or due to differences in theme engines
- Additional aspect ratios created
- Due to no composite element support, the grid view variants were modified to suit box art or titlescreen artwork
- System logos for additional systems supported by ES-DE were created by me 


## **Configuration Options**
